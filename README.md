<h2>This repository consists of the ns3 code of the project. 


_In this project we simulate the performance of a bus station hot spot system in the network based on a multi access point scenario. In this scenario we introduce multiple access points depending on the area of coverage of the network. The users are the nodes connected to these access points. The data services are provided by the access points to the nodes connected to it._

_One of the purposes of this project is to outline the architecture and network topology of a Wi-Fi System in a bus station. We initially implement a basic network to study the architecture with a single access point and multiple nodes to evaluate the performance of the system._

_In the first part of simulation we left the number of users as constant 6 and increased access points from 1 to 4._

_In the second scenario we increased number of users from 4 to 8 along with increasing the number of access point from 1 to 2. In the simulation we tried in studying the performance of the network by considering the throughput, tcp ip protocol is specialized in the simulation._
